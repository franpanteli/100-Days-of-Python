# 100 Days of Python - Udemy

ðŸ’¡ Dr. Angela Yu's course, [_100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp_](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-Days-of-code/), aims to create fluent and well-rounded Python developers by exposing them to a wide array of Python programming concepts and techniques for 100 Days straight. After completing the course, although I didn't complete it within the 100 days, I can confidently say that this was undoubtedly the best online course I've ever taken. Not only did I learn Python from zero-to-hero, but I was also taught things that most other courses skip over such as, but not limited to:
* The importance of understanding the underlying theory behind the code we write
* How to learn effectively and efficiently, and continue to grow your skills
* How to comply with industry best practices and standards as related to Python development

    I would highly recommend this course to anyone that I know that is considering learning Python, or somebody who is even just considering learning to code in general. The knowledge that this course supplied opened doors for me and _accomplished a life goal of mine that I wasn't sure that I'd ever accomplish_. For a full list of concepts and techniques covered in the course, please see the [course syllabus](./syllabus.pdf), or visit the course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-Days-of-code/).

ðŸ§° Local setup instructions and the `requirements.txt` file are included in each project, if you'd like to try any for yourself. 

ðŸš¨ While this repository's filesystem contains the project files that I completed for **all** 100 days of the course, below are the links the projects that were the **_most interesting/signifigant_** to me throughout the course:

> All projects require Python `version >= 3.9` and the packages in their corresponding package requirements to run.
