 # 100 Days of Udemy Python 
## Abstract 
This repository contains my work for Dr Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python bootcamp, [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?kw=100+day&src=sac&couponCode=ACCAGE0923). A full list of concepts covered by the bootcamp is contained in [its syllabus](https://github.com/franpanteli/100-Days-of-Python/blob/main/syllabus.pdf). I completed this as part of my independent learning, to invest in my Python skills. Course material was first exported and notes were written. Capstone projects were next produced, by solving problems presented in course material and producing my own solutions. These were pushed to GitHub, and capstone projects linked to. Local setup instructions and a requirements.txt file are included by each project. This details package requirements and assumes that Python version `>=3.9` is used. This was produced over more than 100 days, to sustainably produce project content.
